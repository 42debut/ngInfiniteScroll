Testing
-------

ngInfiniteScroll uses Testacular for its unit tests, and will attach to an instance of Chrome and PhantomJS. You can use Grunt to run the tests continually with `grunt test`; alternatively, you can run the tests one-off with `npm test`. Note that you will need [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) on your path.
